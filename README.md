# OpenAI Demo
This is a demonstration app that uses the OpenAI API. It was created from a tutorial by Net Ninja, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ipdXMDVcGimIVMG_Z6-Vsu

## Will not work as-is
This application will not work as-is. You will need:

1. an [OpenAI developer](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) account and:
   - load it with some credits
   - generate an API key
2. to create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.sample`.
